# Discord Relay

A plugin for [Paper](https://papermc.io/) to relay chat between Discord and Minecraft.

I no longer for Paper, as I switched to using [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) for my community Minecraft server, so development has continued on the [fabric](https://github.com/viral32111/DiscordRelay/tree/fabric) branch.
